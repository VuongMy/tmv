Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. In order to self-host there are two commands: next build and next start.

next build builds the production application in the .next folder.

next start starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages.

Generally you'll have to follow these steps to deploy to production:

Run npm install
Run npm run build (runs next build)
Potentially copy the .next, node_modules, and package.json to your server.
Run npm run start (runs next start) on the server
